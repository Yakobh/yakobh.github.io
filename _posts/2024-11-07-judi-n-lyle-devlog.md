Finally getting around to making a first post and what better than to mention that I have started a
full game dev project. I know, I know... very original idea to make an indie pixel art game. But
this has been a dream of mine for awhile and now it feels like the right time to see it through.

This will be a game about my dogs, Judi and Lyle and their adventures in the woods as they lose
their way from home. I am excited to be working on a project with the intention of releasing a full
game. I have had the experience of completing some bite sized games through the Godot Wild Game Jam
(see my Games page for those). However, I haven't had the experience of actually completing a larger
project.

I have had some great experiences learning pixel art via Aseprite and I have definitely been getting
the hang of that tool along with art in general. I have taken some drawing and painting courses at
my local rec center and it has honestly taught me so much about myself, art appreciation, and
principles that I can take into many different facets of design and development. Mostly, it has
taught me to trust the process and be patient through the moments when I just want to be at the
finish line. Art is a slow process with lots of iteration and trust in yourself. Game dev in general
is something I view as an interactive art medium which means there are so many facets of creativity
and art that can be layered and expressed in a single canvas. I think it's just a beautiful thing to
get to build and share that experience with others.

I hope you enjoy this experience with me as I attempt to document my journey along the way and show
off some of the cool things I am working on. I am currently planning for this game to be a puzzle
platformer with 2 main character controllers. You will play as both Judi and Lyle as you solve
puzzles with both of their unique abilities and make your way back home. Plus doing foley design
with my dogs is one of the most rewarding creative tasks I have ever done (originally with Judi's
Journey - check it out on my [Game page](https://yakobjorgensen.itch.io/judis-journey)).

I have already done some work to flesh out the initial prototype character controllers with Judi and
Lyle which are mostly taken from the Judi's Journey project. I revamped the sprite sheets and made
them look and feel a lot more like my dogs. I have also put together a preliminary switching
mechanic so you can swap between the dogs and it feels nice so far. Excited to keep working on this
journey and building out some fun worlds for the doggies to explore hopefully with you in the
future. Check out a small demo video below of what I've got so far.
