<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Global Game Jam 2025</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Theme: Bubble</strong></p>

Well, it's been awhile since I've done a game jam. March of last year is the last game jam I
participated in and I think I've been subconsciously itching for it. I saw a post from my local game
dev community that there would be a Global Game Jam site near me. I have been in my own little
*bubble* of Godot Wild Jam and working only with people I already know. I thought that this
time I would expand my horizons, open up my *bubble* and meet some new like-minded people in person.
Wow what an amazing experience that was. I went in without having much expectations, other than
having another awesome game to add to my portfolio and make some friends along the way. Also, this
was only a 48 hour jam which is not something I had done before. I thought this would be a unique
challenge as the only other game jams I had done took place over 9 days which means I had plenty of
time to think and expand and develop.

During this
process I knew I wanted to write up a retrospective for a game jam so I decided to take some notes
and reflect each day during the jam to document the experience. So I thought I would share some of
those reflections with you here.

I had found someone that I clicked with well and knew we could make something great together. He had
never worked with Godot before, and it has been close to 6 or 7 years since I worked with 3D in
games. So this ended up being the perfect compromise where we would use Godot, but make something in
3D which ended up proving to be a really amazing experience. To be frank, I left the first day
without much drive or passion as I wasn't fully invested in the theme of *bubble* nor the overall
progress we had made for the first day. I came home thinking *"I don't really care much what we get
done here, I'm mostly here for the experience and working with new people"*. The whole idea was
based on super monkey ball, a game I vaguely knew and hadn't really watched much gameplay of. So
before I went up to bed, I watched a short gameplay video to get an idea of what we could make.

Then I hopped in the shower and something switched on in my brain. The sudden rush and excitment of
a game jam. Suddenly the pressure became real and the ideas began flowing in my head. My adrenaline
started pumping and I wrote out a whole slough of ideas on my phone.

> Things to get done:
> - Main menu
> - Bathtub scene (area 3D pop bubbles)
> - GUI with timer and health
> - Health mechanic
> - Death mechanic (falling off stage)
> - Tile environment
> - Agglomerative bubble mechanic
> - Skybox
> - Different stage difficulty things
>   - moving platform
> - Different stages
> - Bubble pop sound effect
> - Different text depending on how many bubbles made it into the bath
>   - bubble party
>   - average bath
>   - bubble bath extravaganza
> - Textures for level
> - Bubble particle effect
> - Bubble shader effect

The game - **SUPER BUBBLE BATH 3D**

Then I went to bed excited as ever (the normal curse of the game jam) and ready to roll bright and
early the next morning.


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>25 Jan 2025 Day 2: Huge efforts and long strides</strong></p>

> Lots of amazing progress. Lots of great new friendships formed. Lots of snacks eaten.

> Really cool experience working on 3D and really cool experience getting something done and
> polished in a hyper short timeframe. I felt like we've really been able to knock something well
> polished out in such a short time. Excited to see what tomorrow brings and excited to get
> something submitted!

> It's also hard not to steamroll certain things and just get stuff done. We have such a small
> timeframe so you sort of have to trust each other to get something cool done and working and out
> the door. Though I did sort of take it upon myself to do a lot of the visual direction, but that
> was originally met with welcome arms so I won't feel bad about it.

> I have once again worked myself super hard and I have no chill. But I think that means this is
> what I'm meant to be doing because I have never had such a drive and passion for anything else in
> my life that would force me to non stop think about and work on for a full 48 hours straight.
> Super cool man.

By the end of the first full day of working, I had already formed a really strong bond with someone
I had just met less than 24 hours prior. Not only would I be learning a lot about different tools,
and how to once again work with that dreaded 3rd dimension space, I was continuing to flex my
networking abilities and seek out like-minded individuals.

By this point, we got to experience practicing giving our pitch to a group of 30ish people and
giving a play demo to the group a mere 24 hours into making the game. It was the first time I had
ever pitched and presented a game I had worked on to a group of strangers and the experience was
surreal. People complimented us and lit up with ideas when they saw what we had accomplished. It was
something of a dream, really.

By this point, I knew exactly where our game was headed and what was left to complete. I proceeded
to head home and continue working until about 3 am as I found some free music to use in the game and
recorded myself making a bubble pop sound effect and cleaning it up in Audacity. By this point in
the night, we had a full game loop, main menu, pause menu, and end game scene. We had a game, and
that is what I find most important - having something to submit. This allowed us to spend the
remaining time the final day adding polish, additional levels, and play testing.


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>26 Jan 2025 Day 3: The final push</strong></p>

We finished our game and submitted it to itch. That is the goal and we accomplished it. Not only
that, but we also got the fun experience of showcasing the game we accomplished to the group on a
big stage and had a lot of people approach us afterward to talk about it and give it a play. That
was something that I will keep with me forever, a token and reminder that this is something for me
and something I am good at.

Some cool tools and new things I learned about from fellow participants and organizers were about:
- Twine [https://twinery.org/](https://twinery.org/) a tool for storytelling
- Makeymakey [https://makeymakey.com/](https://makeymakey.com/) a really cool alternative controller
  to make just about anything a controller
- Circuitplayground [https://code.org/maker/circuitplayground](https://code.org/maker/circuitplayground)
  another really cool hardware tool with microcontrollers and other components to have fun with

It had also been awhile since I have worked with physical hardware - something I used to do quite
often actually. So having someone there to nerd out with resparked some of those interests with
hardware and game me some additional ideas of other fun projects I could do in the future to bridge
my interests of game dev with hardware.

Overall, I would 100% do this again (and I am planning to). I learned a lot about myself and gained
some additional confidence in my ability to connect with people, communicate, and make something
*awesome*. I also got to explore the swath of options and node types within Godot that I have never
touched before and it showed me that there is a lot you can do with some basic primitives and some
imagination, they really do go a long way.

You can find the GGJ page [here](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/super-bubble-bath-9) if you'd
like to play.

I hope to be doing maybe one or two more game jams this year to continue to challenging myself and
opening up my creative horizons and skillsets. So hopefully stay tuned for some other retrospective
posts in the future on that. Once again, thank you for spending some time with me here, and I wish
you all the best.
