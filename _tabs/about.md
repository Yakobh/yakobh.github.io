I am a software engineer by trade and a hobbyist game developer by whenever I find the time and
energy. Currently working through balancing all the hobbies I enjoy and honing in on the ones that
bring me the most pleasure - game development being high up on the list. Come join me in some
adventures here as I explore my creativity with game development, art, and maybe some other random
hobbies/side quests who knows. Thanks for checking this blog site out and I hope to give you a smile
or two along the way.
